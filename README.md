# Home-Assistant
# ESP32 6-Relay Board with Home Assistant (Wyse 3040 + SSD Architecture)

This project demonstrates a **stable, low-storage-friendly Home Assistant setup**
using a **Dell Wyse 3040 thin client**, **external USB SSD**, **Docker**, and
an **ESP32-based 6-relay board flashed with ESPHome**.

The architecture is designed specifically for devices with **very limited internal storage**.

---

## 🧠 System Architecture Overview

### Hardware
- Dell Wyse 3040 (low internal eMMC storage)
- External USB SSD (primary data storage)
- ESP32 6-channel relay board

### Key Design Decisions
- Internal storage is used **only for OS**
- All heavy data (Docker, Home Assistant, ESPHome) is moved to **USB SSD**
- ESP32 runs independently and connects directly to Home Assistant
- ESPHome server is **optional** (CLI or Docker-based)

---

## 📂 Final Storage Layout
/mnt/usbssd
├── docker/ # Docker engine data (images, layers, containers)
├── homeassistant/ # Home Assistant config & database
├── esphome/ # ESPHome configs (optional server)


Internal storage:
- DietPi OS only
- No Docker images
- No build cache
- No risk of disk-full crashes

---

## 🐳 Docker Installation (Data Root on SSD)

Docker is installed using DietPi and forced to store all data on the SSD.

```bash
dietpi-software install 162

{
  "data-root": "/mnt/usbssd/docker"
}

docker info | grep "Docker Root Dir"

🏠 Home Assistant Installation (Docker)

docker run -d \
  --name homeassistant \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --network host \
  -v /mnt/usbssd/homeassistant:/config \
  -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
  ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable

Access:

ESPHome Docker (Optional)

docker run -d \
  --name esphome \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 6052:6052 \
  -v /mnt/usbssd/esphome:/config \
  ghcr.io/esphome/esphome

🔌 ESP32 Integration with Home Assistant

Firmware

The ESP32 is flashed with ESPHome firmware (esp32-6relay.yaml).

Once flashed:

* ESP32 connects to Wi-Fi

* Communicates directly with Home Assistant using ESPHome API

* ESPHome server is NOT required to run continuously

Adding ESP32 to Home Assistant

Go to Settings → Devices & Services

ESPHome device is auto-discovered

Click Configure

Enter API encryption key if prompted

Manual method:

Add ESPHome integration

Enter ESP32 IP address
